# 🗼 Tower of Hanoi – Java Implementation
## 📌 Description

This project is a Java-based implementation of the Tower of Hanoi game, a classic problem that demonstrates recursion and divide-and-conquer techniques.
The program shows step-by-step disk movements required to transfer disks from the source rod to the destination rod using an auxiliary rod.

## 🎯 Objectives

Understand recursion in Java

Learn problem decomposition

Practice logical thinking & algorithm design

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Java

JDK 8+

Command Line / IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code)

## ⚙️ How It Works

There are 3 rods: Source, Auxiliary, and Destination

Only one disk can be moved at a time

A larger disk cannot be placed on a smaller one

The algorithm recursively moves disks until all reach the destination rod

## ▶️ How to Run
javac TowerOfHanoi.java
java TowerOfHanoi

## 📊 Sample Output
Move disk 1 from A to C
Move disk 2 from A to B
Move disk 1 from C to B
Move disk 3 from A to C
...

## 🧠 Key Concept Used

Recursion

Base Case & Recursive Case

Time Complexity: O(2ⁿ − 1)

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Add user input for number of disks

Create a GUI version

Add animation / visualization
